# 3d Image Segmentation

__Abstract:__

This project utilized a neural network to do a 3d segmentation of sub-earth geological images. Areas of salt bodies are identified from background  

__Conclusion:__

Using 3D and 2D segmentation obtain similar accuracy.

# Intruduction: background and motivation 
For oil and gas exploration, trained geologists mannually annotate volume of geological images in 2D and 3D . with the rapid development in computer vision, AI has trained to aide human on tasks like
